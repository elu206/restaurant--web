    <h1>Kittens and Coffee</h1>
    <!--Description-->
    <h2>It's a cat cafe.</h2>
    <!--More description-->
    <p>Established early last year on a whim, this cat cafe has become a popular destination for many.  This place started when the owner realized that her friends were all coming over to her house to drink all of her coffee and pet her cats, and she decided that she might as well make money out of it.  Just recently, this business has finally moved out of her house.</p>
    <p>At our brand new location right next to the town vet, we have many different cats that hang out at our cafe, including these adorable ones:</p>
